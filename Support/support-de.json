But here's my best guess at what is coming soon.\n\n#1 - Improvements for new upcoming iOS features.\n\n#2 - Improved Siri Shortcuts if possible, for example enable you to query statistics from within Shortcuts.\n\n#3 - Improvements to widgets.\n\n#4 - Improved Query Log search.\n\n#5 - Implement new Pi-hole API features as soon as they are released.\n\nAlongside these things there are quite a few other ideas I have planned as well. If you have any suggestions please send them my way, I'm all ears!\nThanks, Joost",
